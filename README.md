# Minesweeper
A complete replica of the classic game of Minesweeper. It features three levels of difficulty and a variety of themes that can be selected by the player. Potential mines can be flagged by the user and there is a counter for the number of remaining mines. It also features a timer and reset functionality. 

The entire game was built using Java Swing. The size of the grid and the number of mines vary based on the chosen difficulty level.
